In this directory, you can find the first-stage codes of the project. Here is a short description of each file:

Lectura_datos_DESI.ipynb: This notebook provides a tutorial on how to open, read, and use an Astropy FITS file. You can learn how to utilize the information inside the TableHDU and ImageHDU elements.

Ensayo_h2o_arrays.ipynb: This file demonstrates how to initiate an H2O session, load the flux data, create an H2O frame, and use a prediction model within H2O.

Descarga_datos_B_D_DESI.ipynb: This code shows the process of using the BeautifulSoup library to find each web link from which every DESI file will be read. These links are then pasted into the
                               urlspectra.txt file. In the end, these links are read, and 10 FITS files are created that merge all bright and dark catalog data.

B_R_Z_wavelength.fits: This is a FITS file that contains the B, R, and Z wavelength values.

spectra_smooth.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates some PySpeckit applications, showing how to find the smoothed spectra and perform some fittings.

Extraccion_de_parametros_submuestra.py: This script presents the first insights into analyzing DESI data using 55 features and the H2O models. The best model according to H2O can be found here.

Standardization.ipynb: In this notebook, all 10 original DESI files are opened and standardized with respect to each flux value at each wavelength. It generates another 10 FITS files with the standardized data.
