In this directory, you can find the first-stage codes of the project. Here is presente a short description of every file:

Lectura_datos_DESI.ipynb: Here there is a tutorial about how to open, read, and use an astropy fits file. You can learn how to use the information inside the TableHDU and ImageHDU elements.
Ensayo_h2o_arrays.ipynb: This file shows how to initiate a H2O session, to load the flux data, create a H2O frame and use a prediction model inside H2O.
Descarga_datos_B_D_DESI.ipynb: This code exhibits the procces of using the beatifulSoup library to find each web link from which every DESI file will be readed. Then, this links are paste in the 
                               urlspectra.txt file. In the end, we read this links and create 10 fits files that merge all bright and dark catalogues data.
B_R_Z_wavelenght.fits: This is a fits file that owns the B, R, Z wavelenght values.
spectra_smooth.ipynb: You can learn some pyspeckit applications and how to find the smooth spectra and some fittings.
